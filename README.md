# Parcel Proximity Shiny App

This was a shiny visual I did as  contribution to my group's capstone project.

- The app is an interactive leaflet map of Midland, Texas, showing only parcels that are within a distance set by the user from selected parcel types, which is also set 
by the user.  Ideally one would upload the app to shiny.io and provide the link for others to use, but I'm cheap and not paying to have it available on the server.  So 
for those wish to view the app, follow the instructions below:
  1. Download RStudio
  2. Download "mid_parcel_rds1" and "mid_parcel_rds2" from this repository
  3. Open RStudio and start a new shiny web app: 
      - click (File > New File > Shiny Web Application)
      - add name, select "Single File (app.R), and designate the directory for it to be created in
  4. Copy and paste the script found in "app.R" on this repository to your new Shiny web app in RStudio and save it
  5. create a new folder in the same location as your Shiny web app and name it "data".
